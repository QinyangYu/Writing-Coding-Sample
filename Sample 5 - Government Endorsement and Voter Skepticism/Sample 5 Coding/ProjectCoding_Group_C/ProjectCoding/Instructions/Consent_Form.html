        <b> <p style="font-size: 20px; margin: 0; color: #000;">Brief Introduction:</p></b><br>
        This research aims at helping economists and political scientists understand how voters process information from the government. 
        Participation is voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without penalty. 
        The session will last approximately 20 minutes, during which you will make decisions as a voter that affect your final payment. 
        You will receive detailed instructions at the beginning of the session on how payments are calculated based on your decisions. 
        There are no known risks beyond those of everyday life associated with this study. 
        While there are no direct benefits to you beyond the financial compensation, your participation may help in the development of social science policies.<br><br>

        <b> <p style="font-size: 20px; margin: 0; color: #000;">Confidentiality: </p></b><br>
       Your personal data will remain confidential. We do not have access to identifiable information. 
       All records will be securely stored on password-protected computers, accessible only to the research team.<br><br>
        
        <b> <p style="font-size: 20px; margin: 0; color: #000;">Compensation: </p></b><br>
        Your final payment will consist of a $5 participation fee for completing the session, plus an additional payoff based on the decisions you make during the experiment. 
        Your decisions could result in either a bonus or a penalty beyond the completion fee, while the final payment is guranteed to be positive.
        By paying close attention during the experiment, you increase your chances of earning a bonus and boosting your final payment. <br><br>
