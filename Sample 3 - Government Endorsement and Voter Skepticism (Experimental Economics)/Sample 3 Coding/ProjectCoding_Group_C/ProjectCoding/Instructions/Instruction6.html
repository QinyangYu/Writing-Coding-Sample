        <br>
        You will participate in a total of 20 rounds. 
        <br><br>
        Each round in this experiment operates <b>independently</b> from the others. 
        Both the true state and information dsiclosure will be reset at the beginning of each new round. 
        Consequently, your choices and payments in each round are based solely on the conditions of that specific round, without any influence from your previous actions or outcomes.
        <br><br>
        The computer will <b>randomly select 1 of these 20 rounds</b>, and your additional payoff beyond the completion fee will be your earnings from the selected round.
        Each round has an equal chance of being selected.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Therefore, it is in your best interest to perform well in every single round, as any one of them could determine your final payment!</strong>
